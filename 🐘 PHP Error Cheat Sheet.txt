🐘 PHP Error Cheat Sheet
Error Types

Parse Error (Syntax Error)
Happens when PHP can’t understand your code structure.
Example: Missing semicolon, unmatched braces.

echo "Hello"  // Missing ;


Fatal Error
A critical problem—script execution stops.
Example: Calling an undefined function or including a missing file.

undefinedFunction();


Warning
Non-fatal; script continues, but something went wrong.
Example: Including a missing file with include.

include("missing.php");


Notice
Mild; often about undefined variables or sloppy coding.

echo $notDefined;


Deprecated
You’re using a feature that’s outdated and may vanish in future PHP versions.

split(",", "a,b,c"); // Deprecated

Common Causes

Missing semicolons → Parse error: syntax error

Mismatched quotes/brackets → Syntax or unexpected token errors

Undefined variables → Notice

Undefined functions → Fatal error

Wrong file paths → Warning or Fatal error

Division by zero → Warning

Headers already sent → Warning (caused by output before header() calls)
